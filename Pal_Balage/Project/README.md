# IMPORTANT INFO!!!!!!

I started to develop an astronomical calculator program in Python, and I first comitted it to the following repository:
https://github.com/masterdesky/Astronomical_Survey

At 2018.05.04, 11:50 UT, I migrated the files into this repository and continued to translate it to C++.

## Now it's been moved back to the original repository (https://github.com/masterdesky/Astronomical_Survey), and will stay there forever. Nothing will be uploaded here anymore!
